`Coicons CSS` is a cool, elegent, and cross-browser css icon library for you to use in your projects.

## Basic Usage

1. Include the stylesheet on your document's `<head>`



'<head>'
  <link href="https://coicons.github.io/coicons/coicons.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
'</head>'



2. Add the class `coi` followed by another class [ coi-*icon-name* ] to an <i> tag to display your Coicon. You may also replace with the class `coi-svg` for SVGs which provide better scaling.

3. For default PNG icons three classes are applicable:
   coi (default) | coi-sm (small) | coi-lg  (large)

4. For SVG icons three classes are also applicable:
   coi-svg (default) | coi-svg-sm (small) | coi-svg-lg  (large)


Full example:

------------ html -------------

#PNG

<i class="coi coi-32bit"></i>

#SVG

<i class="coi-svg coi-32bit"></i>

--------------------------------

## Usage

To use Coicons CSS in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's `<head>`, and add the class `coi` to an <i> tag, along with any of the icon names. That's it!
