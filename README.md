# Coicons

Coicons CSS is a cool, elegent, and cross-browser css icon library for you to use in your projects.

## Basic Usage

1. Include the stylesheet on your document's `<head>`


```html
<head>
  <link href="https://goo.gl/9CPwDt" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```



2. Add the class `coi` followed by another class `coi-*icon-name*` to an `<i>` tag to display your Coicon. You may also replace with the class `coi-svg` for SVGs which provide better scaling.

3. For default PNG icons three classes are applicable:
    `_coi (default)` | `coi-sm (small)` | `coi-lg  (large)`

4. For SVG icons three classes are also applicable:
   `coi-svg (default)` | `coi-svg-sm (small)` | `coi-svg-lg  (large)`


## Example:

###### PNG
```html
<i class="coi coi-32bit"></i>
```
###### SVG
```html
<i class="coi-svg coi-32bit"></i>
```

## Usage

To use Coicons CSS in your website, simply add the stylesheet into your document's `<head>`, and add the class `coi` to an `<i>` tag, along with any of the icon names. That's it! :+1:
